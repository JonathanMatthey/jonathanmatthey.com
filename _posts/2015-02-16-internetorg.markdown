company_description:
- <b>Facebook</b> is a social network, that came after myspace and before [insert next big thing].
- <b>B-Reel</b> is an international creative agency working globally offering strategy, design, branding, positioning, digital, traditional and new media advertising services.
team:
- 1 Project Manager
- 2 Designers
- 1 Backend PHP Developer
- 1 iOS Developer
stack: jQuery, Vanilla JS, laravel PHP, html5, scss.
contribution:
- At B-Reel, in a 3 month project I built the desktop and mobile web marketing campaign for facebook's launch of internet.org.  Fully responsive, it told individiual stories of exceptional characters around the world who had achieved some great things without the internet.
- I used plenty of parallax, scroll points, css3 animations and webgl concepts to make this as interactive as possible.  It also degraded gracefully on lower end devices.
