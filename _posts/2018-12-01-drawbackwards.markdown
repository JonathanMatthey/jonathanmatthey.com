<p>
  As part of the Drawbackwards team, I built a number of features for a healthcare client application https://dmehub.com/.</p>
  <p>Redesigning the Create Order flow, billing, reporting, analytics, login, registration and admin dashboards, the codebase is built in vue.js with a laravel backend.</p>

<p>
  The more challenging aspects were building complex custom UI components such as multi file uploaders, custom dropdown selects, check / radio boxes, unit conversion inputs all to match the designed style guide.
</p>

<p>I also fully integrated Stripe.js into the billing portion to support adding and managing payment methods as well as credit card validations</p>
