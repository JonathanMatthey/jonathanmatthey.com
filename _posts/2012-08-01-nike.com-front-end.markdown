contribution:
  Working closely with designers and UX, I built, prototyped and refined final mobile solutions for the main nike.com site.  The biggest challenges were a robust and intuitive navigation, a smooth checkout process, a clean basket and variation of different product pages.
  I also ran performance test with Charles, trying to reduce image sizes and recording the variation in perceived load time.
  On the main desktop site, I built a number of innovative hero displays, animated product rotations, interactive features, as well as building tools for the Nike content creators to understand the concept of breakpoints.
