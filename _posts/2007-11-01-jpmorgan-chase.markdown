company_description: <b>JPMorgan Chase & Co.</b> is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States, and the sixth largest bank in the world by total assets.
team:
- Traders
- 1 Project Manager
stack: Excel VBA, Access, C#, Visual Studio, Java, javascript.
contribution:
- Banks run on Excel. I built and supported front office trading spreadsheets reporting and calculating daily profit and loss, using in-house Alib quant libraries all written in C++. I'd design and build the final dashboards that traders would use on their desks.
- Built a web dashboard to monitor the progress of a middle office process. This was an individual project where I built both backend and front end. SSIS, DTS packages running in the background with C# Asp.net front end to display results. This was way back when ajax was a bit of a new concept, so this was kind of innovative.
