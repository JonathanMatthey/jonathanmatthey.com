<p>
  Helped kenhub.com restyle their front end in Bourbon and Neat.  They had old styling frameworks and were looking for an upgrade.  They had chosen Bourbon and Neat as it worked well with their Rails Framework.
</p>
<p>
  I took their exisiting designs and restructured the html, css, less to produce a fully responsive front end
