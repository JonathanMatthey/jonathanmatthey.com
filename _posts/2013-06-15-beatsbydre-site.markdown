- <b>R/GA</b> is a full service digital agency creating products, services and communications to help grow client's businesses in the connected age.
team:
- 1 Designer
stack: HTML, css, js.
contribution:
- I was brought in to quickly deliver a production ready beatsbydre carousel in 2 days given just a few assets.  It had to be responsive and have 'cool or soft' transitions.  I experimented with timings and delays between background and foreground fades to achieve a smooth ambient reveal feeling.
