company_description:

team:
- 2 Designers
- 1 Project Manager
stack:
  - HTML5, scss, js.
contribution:
- Nike Snowboarding wanted to build anticipation of two upcoming exclusive snowboarding videos by releasing 14 online trailers.
- We designed and built this responsive mini site with full background videos.  Each week a new video would be released until the main 2 videos launched.  The menu scrolls along with your mouse and previews the individual trailers on hover.
- As the original brief was quite vague, we didn't know how much editorial or product content we were getting along with the videos.  I quickly built 4 prototypes in a day using yeoman / html5 boilerplate.  They really helped communicate our ideas to the client for feedback that ended up shaping the final product.
