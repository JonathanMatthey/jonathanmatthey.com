contribution:
- PhilterIt adds a sidebar to gmail with icons corresponding to your recent emails – all built in Backbone.js, with a little twitter bootstrap and a node.js backend. I completely redesigned and coded the gmail plugin that sat in your gmail sidebar, all visual elements, buttons, drop down boxes, tutorial tips, and message boxes.
- I also redesigned the new cleaner splash page that would launch the new version of the plugin
