contribution:
- Launched main site in 3 weeks. It’s a single page landing page projecting the company’s brand and capturing potential clients and personal shoppers through 2 different forms. It uses a trick called parallax to move the background image slower than the foreground objects. The same page has been optimized for iphone and ipads, delivering single column layouts for the smaller devices.
- On the iOS App, I completed the login and registration functionality and fixed a number of bugs in time to push the app to the Appstore.
