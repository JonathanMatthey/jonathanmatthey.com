<p>
	Built a web dashboard to monitor the progress of a middle office process. This was an individual project where I built both backend and front end. SSIS, DTS packages running in the background with C# Asp.net front end to display results.  This was way back when ajax was a bit of a new concept, so this was kind of innovative.
