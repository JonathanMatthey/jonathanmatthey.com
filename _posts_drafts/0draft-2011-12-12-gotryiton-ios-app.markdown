<p>
	Go Try It On! is a fashion tech start up delivers instant community styling advice on your looks.
	Written reviews are a large part of Go Try It On, building on top of that, my first project was to design a Product Recommendation tool where users would be able to selected from a specified list of products and recommend them to other users complimenting their look.
</p>
<p>
	Users can also go to individual fashion stores through the same mobile view, find a product, and tag that product back into the Go Try It On App.
